* approach
** group1: anmoal
- figure out symbol rate
- matched filtering
- sample
** group2: chris, emre
figure out modulation type and order by looking at this scatter plot

considerations:
can use ML or classical methods (using probability models)
in the program itself:
- use probabilities
- maybe have it so that it can take work with a portion of the data and later efficiently incorporate more data if it is needed
