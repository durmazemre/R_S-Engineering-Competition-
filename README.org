* approach
** group1: anmoal
- figure out symbol rate
- matched filtering
- sample
** group2: chris, emre
figure out modulation type and order by looking at this scatter plot

*** considerations:
- can use ML or classical methods (using probability models)
- in the program itself:
  - use probabilities
  - maybe have it so that it can take work with a portion of the data and later efficiently incorporate more data if it is needed
*** k-means
generate synthetic data
